Phoenix Game Jam Referal Brief
Joshua Lewis

Instructions
In this game the aim is to collect orange 'Phoenix' tokens and avoid purple 'Down' tokens
that is, until the Grow Gauge (Top Right Corner) is full, then the aim switches to collecting
down tokens to reduce your health to zero, if your Grow Gauge is full upon death you will rise
like a phoenix and double in size.

Once big enough the player will begin to break the walls around them, once all required walls
are destroyed the player wins.
